  ### Authentication :key:

Some Blockbuster's endpoints can be used without registration or token.

#### How to register?

`/signup` endpoint allows user to signup in the app. After this, the user will be able to get a token, gaining access to new app features.

```json
{
  "username": "documentation",
  "email": "documentation@blockbuster.com",

#### Getting a token

After registration, user will be able to obtain an individual token by accessing to `/auth` endpoint and adding `username` and `email` as in signin. This action should return something like:

```json
